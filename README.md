## Introduction

This repository is designed to help beginners learn Python programming in the context of data analysis. Whether you're new to programming or looking to apply your skills to analyze and process data, these materials aim to provide a structured and hands-on learning experience.

## Sessions

The teaching materials are organized into branches, with each branch corresponding to a specific session. Each session builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing new concepts and reinforcing fundamental programming skills.

- [Session 1](link-to-session-1-branch): Introduction to Python, variables, and basic data types.
- [Session 2](link-to-session-2-branch): Control flow, functions, and basic data structures.
- [Session 3](link-to-session-3-branch): Introduction to libraries (NumPy, Pandas) for data manipulation.
- ...

Feel free to explore the branches to access the teaching materials for each session.
