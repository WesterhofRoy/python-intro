    "You can use the if statement to write a conditional statement.\n",
    "If statements are used to control the flow of execution of the program.\n",
    "The if statement is used to check a condition:\n",
    "if the condition is true, we run a block of statements (called the if-block),\n",
    "else we process another block of statements (called the else-block).\n",
    "The else clause is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement looks as follows:\n",
    "if expression:\n",
    "   statement(s)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "   statement(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "The elif (else if) statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE\n",
    "and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.\n",
    "Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional.\n",
    "However, unlike else, for which there can be at most one statement,\n",
    "there can be an arbitrary number of elif statements following an if.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elif statement looks as follows:\n",
    "if expression1:\n",
    "   statement(s)\n",

    "   statement(s)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "   statement(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "The else statement allows you to execute a block of statements\n",
    "if none of the conditions are true.\n",
    "The else statement is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement evaluates a condition and executes the code inside the block only if the condition is true.\n",
    "Conditions are expressions that evaluate to a boolean value (True or False)."
